This document provides a complete overview of the Student Marks Calculator MVC application. It is a web-based system built to help educators calculate and track student performance based on eight modules with a fifty percent pass rate. The application is developed using ASP.NET Core and offers a user-friendly interface for managing student records, entering module marks, and viewing performance statistics.

The application comes with a robust set of features designed to simplify the grading process. At its core, it allows for complete student management, enabling users to add, edit, view, and delete student records. A key function is the module marks entry system, where marks for all eight modules can be input for each student. The system automatically calculates whether a student has passed or failed based on the predefined criteria, which requires a student to pass at least four out of the eight modules. The user interface is built with Bootstrap, ensuring it is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices. Visual enhancements are provided by Font Awesome icons, and interactive charts powered by Chart.js offer a clear visual representation of performance data.

The technology stack for this project is modern and robust. The backend is built on ASP.NET Core, using C# as the primary programming language. The frontend leverages the Razor view engine alongside Bootstrap for styling and layout. For data visualization, Chart.js is integrated to create dynamic charts. While the current implementation uses in-memory storage for simplicity, the architecture is designed to be easily extended to include a persistent database like SQL Server using Entity Framework Core.

Getting the application up and running is straightforward. The prerequisites include having Visual Studio 2022, the .NET 8.0 SDK, and Git installed on your machine. To begin, you would clone the repository from GitHub using the provided URL. After cloning, you open the solution file in Visual Studio, restore the necessary NuGet packages, and build the solution. The application can then be run directly from Visual Studio by pressing F5, or via the command line using the dotnet run command. Once running, the application is typically accessible at localhost on the designated ports.

Using the application is intuitive and follows a logical workflow. From the home page, you can navigate to the students section. Here, you can create a new student by entering their name. Once a student is created, you can begin entering their module marks by clicking the add marks button. The system guides you through entering marks for each of the eight modules, with a progress bar showing how many have been completed. All marks are validated to ensure they fall within the zero to one hundred range. After all marks are entered, the application instantly calculates and displays the results. You can view detailed results for any student, which includes a breakdown of marks per module, pass or fail status for each, the overall result, and the average mark. For record-keeping, a print-friendly view is available to generate physical or digital reports. The statistics dashboard provides an aggregated view of all students, showing the overall pass rate, the distribution of passed and failed students in a chart, and key metrics like the average, highest, and lowest marks across all modules.

The project is organized into a clean and logical structure within the solution. The Controllers folder holds the logic for handling web requests, with separate controllers for the home page and student-related actions. The Models folder contains the classes that represent the data, such as the Student and ModuleMark entities. Business logic and data operations are abstracted into services, found in the Services folder, which includes an interface and its implementation for student-related functions. The Views folder contains all the Razor view files, organized in subfolders corresponding to their controllers, and a shared folder for the master layout page. Static assets like custom CSS, JavaScript, and third-party libraries are housed in the wwwroot folder.

Contributions to the project are welcome. Those interested in contributing can fork the repository, create a feature branch for their changes, and submit a pull request for review. It is expected that contributors follow standard C# coding conventions and ensure their code is well-tested. The project is open-source and available under the MIT License, which permits wide reuse and modification with appropriate attribution.

Looking ahead, there are several potential enhancements planned for the project. These include integrating a real database like SQL Server for persistent data storage, adding user authentication for secure access, and implementing features to export results to Excel or send reports via email. Other ideas include batch importing of student data from CSV files and developing a companion mobile application.

In summary, the Student Marks Calculator MVC is a fully functional and professionally structured web application that effectively solves the problem of tracking student grades against a specific pass criterion. It is easy to install, simple to use, and built on a solid foundation that allows for future growth and feature additions.
